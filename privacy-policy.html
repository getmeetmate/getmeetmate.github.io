				<div id="infoshare"><strong>2. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</strong></div>
				<div><strong><em>In short:</em></strong><em> We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.</em></div>

						<li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.</li>
						<li><strong>Performance of a Contract:</strong> Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract.</li>

						<li><strong>Vital Interests:</strong> We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>

				<div>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will however take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.</div>
				<div id="inforetain"><strong>4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></div>
				<div><strong><em>In short:</em></strong><em> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></div><div>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 1 year.</div>
				<div>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</div>
				<div id="infosafe"><strong>5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></div>
				<div><em><strong>In short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></div>
				<div>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.</div>

You can find their contact details here: In short<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>.</div><div>If you are a resident in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available here: In short<a href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html</a>.</div>
				<div id="DNT"><strong>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></div>
				<div>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</div>
				<div id="caresidents"><strong>9. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></div>
				<div><em><strong>In short:</strong> Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</em></div>
